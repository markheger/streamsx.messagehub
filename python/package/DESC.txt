Overview
========

Provides functions to read messages from Event Streams as a stream
and submit tuples to Event Streams as messages.

`IBMÂ® Event Streams <https://www.ibm.com/cloud/event-streams>`_ is a fully managed, cloud-based messaging service. Built on Apache Kafka, IBM Event Streams is a high-throughput, fault-tolerant, event management platform that helps you build intelligent, responsive, event-driven applications.

Sample
======

A simple hello world example of a Streams application publishing to a topic and the same application consuming the same topic::

    from streamsx.topology.topology import Topology
    from streamsx.topology.schema import CommonSchema
    from streamsx.topology.context import submit
    import streamsx.messagehub as messagehub

    topo = Topology('MessageHubHelloWorld')

    to_mh = topo.source(['Hello', 'World!'])
    to_mh = to_mh.as_string()

    # Publish a stream to Message Hub using MH_HW topic
    messagehub.publish(to_mh, topic='MH_HW')

    # Subscribe to same topic as a stream
    from_mh = messagehub.subscribe(topo, schema=CommonSchema.String, topic='MH_HW')

    from_mh.print()

    submit('STREAMING_ANALYTICS_SERVICE', topo)
